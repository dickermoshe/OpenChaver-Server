- If we are targeting commercial clients which would be deployed at a large scale then we should add more detail on the `devices`, so the admin can have an easier time tracking which ones are on the system and which aren't.
> I.e. device name, OS, IP, possibly even the version the PC is using (Windows 11 Build 2009.12.123456)
- Have a bulk tools option for commercial accounts (similar to domains.google/)
> Have the option to add many/all devices to get reported to a person or group in one click
- Under `/accountabilty` have the option to white/black list domains to filter
- Share access for a single account to other ITs on the team, possibly with an option to have the main IT approve the config
- We'll need to collect some more info about users, both for security and an improved experience.
- Track logins by IP & time upto a month ago or last five
